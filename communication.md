Prompt 1 (Customer email):

Subject: Update on Your Image Upload Issue

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about the broken image issue you encountered after uploading to the CMS.

After investigating, we found that the image file did not process correctly due to a temporary glitch in the image handling system. This caused the image to fail to display properly on your page.

Our technical team is actively working to resolve this, and we expect the fix to be rolled out within the next 24 hours. Once fixed, simply re-uploading the image should display it correctly.

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Company] Support Team

Prompt 2 (Slack message to backend team):

Hey team,

We discovered that the broken image issue after CMS uploads is caused by the image processing service failing to generate the correct image URLs. I verified this by uploading test images and checking server logs; the request to image processing returns a 500 error intermittently.

Since the error originates from the image processing service (backend), this needs backend attention to fix the root cause. Frontend changes alone won’t resolve it.

Please let me know if you need any additional details. Thanks!
